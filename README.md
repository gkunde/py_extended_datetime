# Extended DateTime

> **IMPORTANT:**
>
> Please consider this project as alpha release. Breaking changes may not always be documented or logged.

An extension library for Python's built-in datetime class. Providing additional methods to perform common date calculations, and provide attributes related to the object's values.

The goal of this library is to provide convience methods to a datetime object, reducing the number additional modules and packages needed to perform similar operations.

## Features
* Inherits from datetime, making any object generated by this class compatible with existing code expecting to work with a datetime object.
* Only uses Python's built in libraries. Beneficial to projects attempting to reduce package dependencies.

## Examples
### Adding dates
```python
current_date = ExtendedDateTime(datetime.utcnow())

# equivalent to current_date + timedelta(days=1)
tomorrow = current_date.date_add(days=1) 

# There are even months!
next_month = current_date.date_add(months=1)

# equivalent to `current_date + timedelta(days=365)`, but accounting for leap years
next_year = current_date.date_add(years=1)
```

## Important: Adding years or months
The ability to add years and months assumes the calculation is made from the same starting point. This means if you need to calculate dates multiple months into the future or past, that you always use the same starting point, and add the number of months or years needed.

If dates are chained, meaning the each derived object is used to calculate the next one, depending on the date, they may alter the day of the month until a common day is reached.

For example, if your starting date is the 31st of January, and 1 month is added to that date, the results will be the 28th of February (non-leap year.) If you add a month to that date, the result will be the 28th of March. If the goal is to calculate the end of every month, this appraoch will not yield the desired result.

To avoid the taget from sliding, always use your starting date to generate each date in the series.
